# Insurance_Project

Our exploration of the Medical Cost Personal Datasets delved deep into uncovering insights about insurance pricing dynamics. Employing diverse analytical tools and rigorous testing methodologies, we identified the age group between 40 to 60 as the primary demographic generating the highest charges. Moreover, we found that age, BMI, number of dependents, and smoking habits significantly influence insurance prices, while gender does not. By leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy, along with Linear Regression models for analysis, we ensured thorough examination and accurate interpretation of the dataset. This endeavor underscores our commitment to delivering nuanced insights, promoting fairness and equity in insurance pricing strategies.
